Meta-Level Science: Lessons from Artificial Intelligence, Software
Engineering, and Computer Science.

Science is a continual and methodical process to match models to data
(phenomenom) for utilitarian purposes.

Science has the following Elements:
  - Data
  - Models (e.g. Theories)
  - Properties of Models, including computational characteristics and
  data matching measures.
  - Properties of Data, including measures of how data matches the
    real world.

Science has no opinions, has no votes, no laws, no authorities, only
naked properties, measures, and characteristics.

[WLA note: some good ideas and some confused ideas all mixed up
together.]
