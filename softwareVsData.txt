Comment added: regarding information and evidence regarding the
lifetime of scientifc data, a 1995 NRC Report "Preserving Scientific
Data on Our Physical Universe" (http://www.nap.edu/catalog/4871.html) provides the following
recommendations regarding retention criteria and the appraisal
process (p. 40):
"As a general rule, all observational data that are nonredundant,
useful, and documented well enough for most primary uses should be
permanently maintained. Laboratory data sets are candidates for
long-term preservation if there is no realistic chance of repeating
the experiment, or if the cost and intellectual effort required to
collect and validate the data were so great that the long-term
retention is clearly justified. For both observational and
experimental data, the following retention criteria should be used
to determine whether a data set should be saved: uniqueness, adequacy
of documentation (metadata), availability of hardware to read the data
records, cost of replacement, and evaluation by peer review. Complete
metadata should define the content, format or representation,
structure, and context of a data set."
